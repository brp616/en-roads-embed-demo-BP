      While large oil companies and the current U.S. administration tout carbon capture as a key step in reducing the impacts of climate change, the En-ROADS climate simulator helps demonstrate that its impacts are minimal and dwarfed by demand-side solutions like a carbon tax or energy efficiency gains.

<h3><u>Sequestration and its Limits</u></h3>
    <p>Companies around the world are racing to capture and store carbon, whether by injecting it underground, mineralizing it, or promising that one day, a new technology will arise that will wholesale “erase” their emissions. Oil company advertisements and press releases, along with news outlets like the New York Times and NPR, have all touted carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as an “essential [tool] for helping society achieve net-zero emissions.” Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” contains potentially billions in incentives for carbon emitters to further CCS projects.<a href="https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/fact-sheet-CCS-ADR.pdf">[3]</a>, may jeopardize precious time and crucial funding for climate solutions that tackle the root cause of our broken system – high energy consumption. To put it simply, CCS alone takes a mop to carbon emissions while the faucet is wide open.</p>
<p>
Tools from MIT’s <em>En-ROADs</em> simulator make this clear - increasing global investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) by a factor of ten, translating to hundreds of billions in annual spending, <strong>reduces projected temperature rise by only ~0.1°C</strong> by 2100. The graph below allows for testing of various levels of CCS funding and progress on global temperature over time, taking into account a comprehensive, system-wide view of climate factors.

            This minimal impact is not because sequestration “doesn’t work.” It does. The issue is scale. Capturing carbon after combustion requires massive energy and infrastructure, and it treats the symptom, not the root cause: continued dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    <p>It also offers a comfortable narrative for emitters. Oil producers can keep extracting and refining, as long as they promise to “offset” their footprint through capture or storage. The problem is that this promise doesn’t add up at the planetary scale.</p>
    <p>Systems thinking, the underlying philosophy that powers the En-ROADs simulator, prompts us to explore levers that change the conditions leading to unchecked fossil fuel consumption rather than mitigate impact a-posterori.</p>

      </p>
      <br>
  <h3><u>Addressing Climate Change at the Systems Level: Demand-Side Solutions</u></h3>
    <p>Instead of focusing on CCS after emissions happen, demand-side solutions like carbon pricing and energy efficiency tackle the root cause of emissions: high energy consumption. By making fossil fuels more expensive and improving how efficiently we use energy, these solutions reduce the amount of carbon we emit in the first place.
      Carbon taxes both reduces overall emissions and incentivizes the adoption of cleaner energy sources. While this could result in downstream impacts on consumers, equitable program design can help mitigate these effects. Efficiency gains can also translate to less required energy for the same actions, reducing emissions without sacrificing quality of life.
    </p>
    <p>Using En-ROADS, we can see that implementing a global carbon price of $100 per ton and improving energy efficiency in new buildings to the maximum level can reduce projected temperature rise by over 0.5°C by 2100. This impact is orders of magnitude greater impact than massive investments in CCS.</p>

      </p>
      <p>These demand-side solutions not only reduce emissions more effectively than CCS but also offer co-benefits like improved air quality, energy security, and economic savings over time. By reducing our overall energy consumption, we can create a more sustainable and resilient energy system that benefits both people and the planet.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>Systems Thinking: The Path Forward</u></h3>
<p>Real climate progress requires more than any single technology or policy. It demands systematic change that can only come from a comprehensive systems-driven approach. Carbon sequestration, carbon pricing, and efficiency measures can all interact within the complex web of economic, political, and behavioral forces to make positive change - but CCS alone is no silver bullet. The En-ROADS simulator underscores that lasting change comes not from treating symptoms but from shifting the underlying structures of our energy system to create a healthier world. By understanding how policies ripple through supply chains, consumer behavior, and technological innovation, we can design interventions that reinforce one another rather than compete for attention and resources. In short, systems thinking helps us move beyond silver bullets and towards systemic solutions that align incentives, technology, and behavior to improve our world.
